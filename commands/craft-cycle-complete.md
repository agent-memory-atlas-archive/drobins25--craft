# Cycle Complete

Complete and archive a cycle. Ensures learnings are reflected before archiving.

## When to Use

- All stories in the cycle are complete
- User explicitly ends cycle early
- Cycle has been abandoned and needs archival

## Flow

### Step 1: Verify Cycle State

Set `cycle_dir` to `.craft/cycles/${ACTIVE_CYCLE}`.

Use **Grep** with pattern `^status: complete`, path `$cycle_dir/stories/`, glob `*.md`, output_mode `files_with_matches` → count results → `stories_complete`.

Use **Glob** with pattern `$cycle_dir/stories/*.md` → count results → `stories_total`.

**If stories incomplete:**
Use **AskUserQuestion**:
```yaml
question: "[N] of [M] stories complete. End cycle anyway?"
header: "Cycle"
options:
  - label: "Complete cycle"
    description: "Archive incomplete stories to backlog"
  - label: "Continue working"
    description: "Finish remaining stories first"
```

---

### Step 2: Check for Pending Learnings & Ungraduated Fixes

Use **Grep** with pattern `status: pending`, path `.craft/.learnings.yaml`, output_mode `count` → `pending_count`. If file doesn't exist, `pending_count = 0`.

Also count ungraduated fix records and the rule-pass threshold:

```bash
FIX_COUNT=$(bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/count-ungraduated-fixes.sh")
THRESHOLD=$(grep -m1 '^rule_pass_threshold:' "${CRAFT_PROJECT_ROOT:-.}/.craft/settings.yaml" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^rule_pass_threshold:[[:space:]]*//')
THRESHOLD=${THRESHOLD:-10}
```

**If `pending_count > 0` OR `FIX_COUNT >= THRESHOLD`:**

Name the reason(s) that apply:

> "There are [N] pending learnings that haven't been converted to harness yet."
> "[FIX_COUNT] fixes have accumulated since the last rule pass - reflect can mine them for graduation-worthy rules."
>
> "Reflect before archiving?"

Use **AskUserQuestion**:
```yaml
question: "Reflect before archiving?"
header: "Reflect"
options:
  - label: "Yes, reflect now"
    description: "Run /craft:reflect (learnings drain and/or rule pass), then archive"
  - label: "Skip reflection"
    description: "Keep everything pending, just archive cycle"
```

**If "Yes, reflect now":** Run `/craft:reflect`, then continue to Step 3. Reflect owns the rule-pass offer - this step only routes into it, never presents the pass itself.

**If "Skip reflection":** Learnings remain in `.craft/.learnings.yaml` with `status: pending` and the fix watermark is untouched — both will be available for the next reflection.

---

### Step 2b: Walkthrough Check (UI Cycles)

Check if the cycle has UI stories that should be walked through before archiving.

Use **Grep** with pattern `^type: ui`, path `$cycle_dir/stories/`, glob `*.md`, output_mode `files_with_matches` → count → `ui_stories`.

**If ui_stories > 0:**

> "This cycle has [N] UI stories. Running a walkthrough to check the live experience before archiving."

**Assemble the walkthrough brief** from what the orchestrator already knows:

1. **Dev server**: Read `project.md` for `package_manager` and dev scripts. Build the start command (e.g., `npm run dev`). Check common ports (5173, 3000, 8080) or parse from project config.
2. **URL**: Infer from project type. Static HTML → `file://` path or localhost. Next.js → `localhost:3000`. Vite → `localhost:5173`. Check project.md for hints.
3. **Test plan**: For each `type: ui` story, read the story file and extract:
   - Feature name (from title)
   - How to trigger it (from acceptance criteria or spark - e.g., "click Command 1 button")
   - What should happen (from acceptance criteria - e.g., "recipe card appears with image and ingredients")
4. **Story context**: Include each UI story's spark (1-2 sentences) so the agent understands what was built.

**Pass the brief to the walkthrough-analyzer agent via Task:**

```
Brief:
  Dev server: [command to start, e.g., "npm run dev"]
  URL: [e.g., "http://localhost:5173"]

  Test plan:
    1. [Feature name]
       Trigger: [how to activate it]
       Expected: [what should happen]
    2. [Feature name]
       Trigger: [how to activate it]
       Expected: [what should happen]
    ...

  Story context:
    - [Story 1 title]: [spark]
    - [Story 2 title]: [spark]
```

**After the walkthrough agent returns:**

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/references/analysis-bug-filing.md` and follow it inline, with `found_during` = `craft cycle-complete walkthrough: <title>`. `<title>` is the title in `$cycle_dir/cycle.yaml`, falling back to the cycle directory name when the title is missing.

Print the reference's report-back line (or "Walkthrough clean." when nothing was found) and remember how many bugs were filed for Step 5. Filing never pauses the run. Proceed to Step 3.

---

### Step 3: Handle Incomplete Stories

If cycle ends with incomplete stories, move them back to backlog:

Use **Grep** with pattern `^status: (ready|active)`, path `$cycle_dir/stories/`, glob `*.md`, output_mode `files_with_matches` → list of incomplete story files.

For each incomplete story file:
```bash
mv "$story" .craft/backlog/
```

Note in cycle.yaml:
```markdown
## Incomplete Stories

The following stories were returned to backlog:
- story-name-1 (0/3 chunks)
- story-name-2 (1/4 chunks)
```

### Step 3c: Surface Unread Observations

Before archiving, surface any unread implementer observations for this cycle - cycle-complete is a human-step-in moment. This must run BEFORE Step 4 (Archive), while `ACTIVE_CYCLE` is still set (complete-cycle.sh clears it).

- **If `RUN_MODE == autonomous`:** skip - leave observations in their sidecars to accumulate; do not surface, route, or create a todo unattended.
- **Otherwise:** recompute the count:
  ```bash
  bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/observations-count.sh ".craft/cycles/$ACTIVE_CYCLE"
  ```
  If it prints a non-empty `N unread / M stories`, **Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/references/observations-surfacing.md` and run it inline** (cluster -> prose digest -> route each cluster to the user's choice -> mark surfaced LAST). If empty, say nothing and continue to Step 4.

---

### Step 4: Archive Cycle

**Run the transition script:**
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/complete-cycle.sh
```

This updates:
- Cycle: `CYCLE_STATUS = complete`, `CURRENT_STORY` cleared
- cycle.yaml: `status: complete`, `updated: [date]`
- Global: `ACTIVE_CYCLE` cleared, `CURRENT_STORY` cleared

---

### Step 5: Cycle Complete Summary

> "**Cycle Complete: [Name]**
>
> **Stories:** [N] completed, [M] returned to backlog
> **Duration:** [start] → [end]
> Bugs filed: <N> (include this line only when the walkthrough filed any)
>
> **What's next?"

Use **AskUserQuestion**:
```yaml
question: "Cycle complete. What's next?"
header: "Next"
options:
  - label: "Start new cycle"
    description: "Create cycle from backlog or new work"
  - label: "Review backlog"
    description: "See what's queued up"
  - label: "Take a break"
    description: "Done for now"
```

## Remember

- **Reflect before archive** — prompt to convert learnings first
- **Learnings persist** — pending learnings stay in `.craft/.learnings.yaml` even if skipped
- **Incomplete stories return to backlog** — nothing gets lost
- **Cycle archival is just state change** — learning conversion is reflect's job
- **The walkthrough files bugs and never fixes; bug then /craft:adhoc is the fix path.**
