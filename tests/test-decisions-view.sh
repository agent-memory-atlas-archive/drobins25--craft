# Usage: bash tests/test-decisions-view.sh
#
# Every subcommand - `shelf`, `group`, `empty`, `archive` and `card` in all
# five faces including reopen - emits plain key=value data (no
# box-drawing character and no ANSI escape anywhere in stdout), and this
# suite draws that data through `draw_rail` - a literal implementation of
# commands/craft-decisions.md's ### The drawing rule - to reproduce story
# 7's normative Shelf and card exhibits line for line. The reopen face's
# diff rows carry a MARK= key the drawing rule colours; the script emits
# no colour itself.
