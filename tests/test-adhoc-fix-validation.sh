# test-adhoc-fix-validation.sh - Verify the adhoc fix flow makes a newly added
# check prove itself against the broken version before it counts as validation.
#
# A fix with no implementer has no tests-first rule, so Step 5 of fix.md must
# ask for it: run the added test or structural check before the edit and see it
# fail on exactly the bug, run it after and see it pass, record both runs. A
# check that never ran against the broken version has proven nothing.
#
# Assertions are SECTION-SCOPED (fence-aware awk between ## headings): the
# bullet must live inside Step 5, directly above the All fixes bullet. A
# file-wide grep would pass if a later edit moved it elsewhere. The control
# assertion proves the section lookup itself works, so a red on the bullet
# assertions can only mean the bullet is missing or misplaced.
