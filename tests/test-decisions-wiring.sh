# test-decisions-wiring.sh - Structural coverage for /craft:decisions wiring
#
# The command file's routing rule now lives ONLY in its dot graph: a
# question is a diamond, an answer is a one-word arrow label, a
# destination is a node. This test never holds a byte-pinned copy of that
# graph - it parses it and asserts structure (labels defined, fan-out
# bounded, every node reachable, no script call hiding in prose) the same
# way evals/check-edges.sh does, and reuses that script's own edge and
# node grammar deliberately, so the two parsers never drift apart by
# reading the fence two different ways.
#
# The prose below the graph is technique only (the drawing rule,
# card-authoring rules, receipts) - what survives it is a capped, named
# list of literal phrases, not a growing pile of ad hoc greps.
